It runs as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which means that users do not have to worry about the intricacies of maintaining it. Cosmos has several features, including massive scale, ease of use, and easy administration ((Source: &quot;https://mscosmos.visualstudio.com/CosmosWiki/_wiki/wikis/Cosmos.wiki?wikiVersion=GBwikiMaster&amp;pagePath=/Cosmos+Big+Data+Platform%2fCosmos+Features&quot;)). Cosmos can handle scaling of infrastructure and other services needed to keep it running, and resources are provisioned for the team, allowing immediate productivity. Cosmos manages load balancing, hardware support, maintenance monitoring, health checks, and many more so teams can focus on creating the analytics and applications to drive their business forward. Cosmos is optimized for max utilization of hardware, allowing teams to store all analytical data in one place.

Features\\n\\nCosmos is Microsoft&#39;s preeminent big data solution. Not only can it store huge amounts of data, but at the fraction of cost compared to other solutions, including Azure Storage. It runs as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) which means you don&#39;t have to worry about any of the intricacies of maintaining it. Check out Cosmos&#39; capabilities below.\\n\\n##Massive Scale\\n\\n- Cosmos has MASSIVE scale.

According to this document, the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and contribute to the warming of the Earth ((Source: \\\\\\&quot;https://aka.ms/ImpactsGreenhouseGas\\\\\\&quot;)). Additionally, deforestation leads to the loss of carbon sinks, such as forests, which would otherwise absorb CO2 from the atmosphere ((Source: \\\\\\&quot;https://wikinew.rem/Deforestation\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\&quot;https://aka.ms/ImpactsGreenhouseGas\\\\\\&quot;)).

According to this document, the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and contribute to the warming of the Earth ((Source: \\\\\\&quot;https://aka.ms/ImpactsGreenhouseGas\\\\\\&quot;)). Additionally, deforestation leads to the loss of carbon sinks, such as forests, which would otherwise absorb CO2 from the atmosphere ((Source: \\\\\\&quot;https://wikinew.rem/Deforestation\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\&quot;https://aka.ms/ImpactsGreenhouseGas\\\\\\&quot;)).

Not only can it store huge amounts of data, but at the fraction of cost compared to other solutions, including Azure Storage. It runs as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) which means you don&#39;t have to worry about any of the intricacies of maintaining it. Check out Cosmos&#39; capabilities below.\\\\n\\\\n##Massive Scale\\\\n\\\\n- Cosmos has MASSIVE scale. It supports Petabyte range datasets and incredible amounts of computation.\\\\n- Cosmos essentially has unlimited capacity which means it can store any amount of data.\\\\n- Teams wont have to worry about the complexities of making huge amount of data highly available, recoverable, and resilient\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDocument 5:\\\\nTitle: Cosmos Features &gt; #Cosmos Tools\\\\nURL: https://mscosmos.visualstudio.com/CosmosWiki/_wiki/wikis/Cosmos.wiki?wikiVersion=GBwikiMaster&amp;pagePath=/Cosmos+Big+Data+Platform%2fCosmos+Features\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#Cosmos Tools\\\\n\\\\nCosmos can work with other services as PowerShell for automation, Synapse for Orchestration, and Azure Data Lake Storage for big data.
